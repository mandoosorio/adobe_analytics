# Day 1: Business Requirements and Set-up

## Pre-Implementation Tasks
- explain how to derive key performance indicators (KPIs) from key business requirements (KBR)
- KBR: goal or objective that is critical for business success
- KPI: metrics that help assess whether or not you are reaching your business goals
- BRD(business requirements document) is generated by the admin and shared with the organization, includes list of goals, metrics and supporting requirements. Also called the solutions Design reference document (SDR) as well

### Steps to determine KBR and KPI
- define KBR
- identify KPI
- map metrics to report suite
- discovery questions: what is our company trying to achieve -> KBR: increase sales -> KPI: page views, visits, clicks -> Data Elements: adobeDataLayer.page.name -> Mapping: event5, pageName [can create spreadsheet]

### Website Data Layer
A data layer that is inserted into a webpage in the form of an object

### BRD Sample Document (spreadsheet)
- 3 sections: Predefined events, Custom Events, Custom Conversion - eVars
- can separate in as many sections as needed

### Virtual Machine Login
- login to axis vm
- login to Adobe Launch with test credentials

### Lifecycle
- visitor views web page
- web server returns web page
- send web beacon (image request) to adobe server
- send transparent pixel
- web analysis data stored in report suites
- analysts can view reports

### Report Suites
- each report suite is a collection of data
- global report suite is when data is sent from multiple sites, apps, or experiences into a single global report suite
- Use Page Flow for a good representation on how users navigate through pages

### Virtual Report Suites
- segmented views that function as regular report suites
- control user access to specific segments of data
- instantly retroactive and editable
- no limit on number of Virtual

### Data Types
#### Dimensions
- typically describe how reports should be interpreted row by row
    - city, state, country
    - by browser
    - by campaign name
    - by product

#### Metrics
- measure actions and provide further context to the dimension selected
    - number of page views
    - number of cc apps processed
    - number of orders
    - amount of revenue generated

#### Variable Types
- Dimensions - Traffic Variables (s.props) : page name (change constantly/often)
- Dimensions - Conversion Variables (eVars) : holds information that lasts longer (session info) search term - leads to success event
- Metrics - Success events (s.events) : when all steps are completed to get to this event
- props do not persist between pages: page name, url, etc
- evars persist until their value is overwritten by another, or expires (session)
- success events can be key actions, page view can be an event

### Adobe Analytics Extension
- library management: set report suite
- general: preset -> utf8
- link tracking: never track -> domain bc we only want to track anything after (not before) domain (end points)
    - if use never track, the base url will not appear on data 
- domain periods: how many sections the domain is divided into by periods (adobedv.servicenow.com) = 3 periods

### Web Install
- uncheck "load library asynchronously"
- _satellite.getVar("pageName") where pageName is a data collection item
- consier how people access your page, how do they get to the landing page 

### Rules
- naming convention: 06-02 All Pages Rule (90) : the (90) will rank the rule so that it executes after all the numbers before it
- Page Bottom event type triggers when you are about to leave the page

### Data Element Viewer Browser Script
https://jimalytics.com/implementation/data-element-viewer-for-adobe-launch/
``` javascript:(function(){if('undefined'!=typeof _satellite)if(void 0!==_satellite._container){var dataElementValue,dataElementNames=[],dataElementObject={},cleanElementObject={};function checkDataElements(){for(var e in _satellite._container.dataElements)dataElementValue=_satellite.getVar(e),dataElementNames.push(e),''===dataElementValue&&(dataElementValue=' '),dataElementObject[e]=dataElementValue,''!==_satellite.getVar(e)&&_satellite.getVar(e)!==_satellite._container.dataElements[e].defaultValue&&(cleanElementObject[e]=dataElementValue);return{everything:dataElementObject,clean:cleanElementObject}}function displayDataElements(e,t){console.group('RAW Data Elements - Data Element Viewer by Jimalytics - https://jimalytics.com'),console.table(e),console.groupEnd(),console.group('CLEAN Data Elements - Data Element Viewer by Jimalytics - https://jimalytics.com'),console.table(t),console.groupEnd()}function returnData(){var e=checkDataElements();displayDataElements(e.everything,e.clean)}returnData(),window._satellite=window._satellite||{},window._satellite._monitors=window._satellite._monitors||[],window._satellite._monitors.push({ruleTriggered:function(e){returnData()}})}else console.log('Adobe Launch is not present.');else console.log('Adobe Launch is not present.');})(); ```
- right click bookmark section and add a page, paste this script in url field
